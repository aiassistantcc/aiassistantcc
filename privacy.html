        <p><strong>Private AI Assistant</strong> is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy outlines how we handle any data within the app, ensuring full transparency.</p>
        
        <h2>Information Collection</h2>
        <p>This application does not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) or any data related to your interactions and chats. We do not track or store personal details, chat histories, or any other private information. All data generated or used by the application is stored locally on your device or within your local network, depending on your configuration, particularly if you are using Ollama.</p>

        <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
        <p>All data, including AI model interactions, is kept locally on your device. If you're using Ollama, your data remains within your local network and is not transmitted to any external servers. This ensures full privacy and local control over your information.</p>

        <h2>Use of IDFA</h2>
        <p>The only information this app collects is the Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA). This is used solely for gathering statistics on total app installations. IDFA data is not shared with any third-party entities and is only used for internal purposes to understand app distribution.</p>

        <h2>Opting Out of IDFA Collection</h2>
        <p>If you prefer not to share IDFA, you can opt out of its collection through your iOS device settings. Simply go to <strong>Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Tracking</strong> and disable "Allow Apps to Request to Track".</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not share any data collected by the application, including IDFA, with third parties. All data remains within the app's internal scope and is never used for marketing, analytics, or other third-party purposes.</p>
        
        <h2>Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page. By continuing to use the app, you acknowledge and agree to the latest version of the privacy policy.</p>
